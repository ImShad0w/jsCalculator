# jsCalculator
This is the final project for: The fundamentals course of The Odin Project(TOP)

# Difficulties
The most difficult part of this project, for me atleast, it was at the beggining, when setting up the eventListeners, and the changes of the variables and etc...
CSS was a lot easier this time, since the whole project is smaller in general.
